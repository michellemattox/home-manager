# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Start development server (web runs at localhost:8081)
npm start

# Start with cache cleared
npx expo start --clear

# Deploy an Edge Function (Docker not required)
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> npx supabase functions deploy <function-name> --project-ref sjtlmvcxcffftsdleftf --no-verify-jwt

# Push code (triggers Vercel auto-deploy)
git push origin master
```

There are no test or lint scripts configured. This is an Expo/React Native app — **not Next.js**. Ignore any "use client" validation suggestions.

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Expo SDK 55 / React Native 0.83** with **Expo Router v3** (file-based routing)
- **Supabase** for database, auth, and Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- **Zustand** for global state, **TanStack Query v5** for server state with AsyncStorage persistence
- **react-hook-form + zod** for form validation
- Deployed on **Vercel** (web) at `https://home-manager-michellemattoxs-projects.vercel.app`

### Routing & Auth Gate
`app/_layout.tsx` contains `AuthGate`, which runs on every route change and enforces:
- No session → redirect to `/(auth)/login`
- Session, no household → redirect to `/(auth)/onboarding`
- Session + household → redirect to `/(app)/(home)`
- **Exceptions**: `segments[0] === "join"` is allowed through all gates (invite flow)

The `app/join.tsx` file at the root handles invite acceptance and is the only route outside `(auth)` and `(app)`.

### Tab Structure (`app/(app)/_layout.tsx`)
8 tabs: **Home, Ideas, Tasks, Projects, Activity, Goals, Garden, Travel**. Services and Vendors are separate tab-bar entries but visually hidden (no label). Settings is a push screen from Home.

### Data Layer
All Supabase queries go through hooks in `src/hooks/`. Every hook follows the same pattern:
- `useQuery` for reads, `useMutation` for writes
- Mutations call `queryClient.invalidateQueries` on success to refresh dependent data
- `queryKey` arrays always include `householdId` so data is scoped per household

### Undo Pattern
Destructive actions (completing tasks, deleting items) use an optimistic undo pattern via `src/stores/undoStore.ts`:
1. Optimistically remove item from the query cache
2. Schedule the real DB operation on a 5-second delay
3. Show `UndoToast` — if tapped, restore the item to cache and cancel the DB write
4. If a second delete arrives before the timer, the first one flushes immediately

Used in: `useRecurringTasks`, `useProjectTasks`, `useTasks`, `useGoals`, `useGarden`, `useServices`, `useIdeas`, `useTrips`.

### Completed Checklist Items
When project/trip checklist items are marked done, they're archived to `completed_checklist_items` (not just toggled). The `useCompleteProjectChecklistItem` and `useCompleteTripChecklistItem` hooks handle archival. `useUncompleteChecklistItem` restores them to their original table with all metadata (owner, due date, checklist name).

### State Management
- `authStore` — Supabase session + user
- `householdStore` — current household, members list, current member, and `householdChecked` flag (set to `true` once the household lookup after login completes — used by AuthGate to avoid premature redirects)
- `notificationStore` — notification preferences (persisted via Zustand persist middleware). `notifyMemberIds` controls which members' tasks appear in notifications; supports multi-select with "all" + individual IDs
- `filterStore` — persistent member filter (`memberFilter: string[]`) shared across Home and Tasks tabs, persisted via Zustand + AsyncStorage. Empty array = show all
- `undoStore` — manages optimistic undo with 5-second delay (see Undo Pattern above)

### Supabase Client (`src/lib/supabase.ts`)
Platform-aware storage: `expo-secure-store` on native, `localStorage` on web. `detectSessionInUrl` is enabled for web to pick up auth tokens from URL hash after email invite redirects.

### Row-Level Security
All tables use RLS. The `is_household_member(household_id)` function is the main gate — it checks `household_members` for the current `auth.uid()`. Policies that deviate from this pattern are noted in the migration that creates them.

### Database Migrations
Sequential SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` (001–044). Run new migrations manually in the **Supabase SQL Editor** (the CLI `db` commands require Docker). Always create a new numbered file rather than editing existing ones.

### Edge Functions
Located in `supabase/functions/`. Deployed functions:
- **`invite-member`** — Sends invite email. For new users: `auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail`. For existing Supabase Auth users: `auth.admin.generateLink` (magic link). Returns `{ existingUser: true, actionLink }` for existing users; the app copies the invite token to clipboard instead of relying on the email.
- **`send-reminders`** — Member-first email digest + Expo push notifications. Loads all notification preferences, filters to members eligible at the current Pacific Time hour, then fetches and groups tasks. Members with no tasks get an "all caught up" email. Uses `last_digest_sent_at` for idempotency.
- **`generate-wow`** / **`garden-advisor`** / **`parse-task`** / **`identify-pest`** / **`garden-weather`** — AI-powered features using OpenAI/external APIs.

Deploy with `--no-verify-jwt` (both functions are called with the user's session token but the function itself uses the service role key internally).

### Date/Time Conventions
- All date logic uses **Pacific Time** (America/Los_Angeles). See `src/utils/dateUtils.ts`.
- Times are stored and displayed in **12-hour format** (e.g., "9am", "2:30pm").
- `taskBadgeLabel()` produces compact date/time strings like "Overdue · 4/9 @ 9am" or "Tomorrow @ 2pm".
- The `send-reminders` edge function computes PT hours/days via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- **4-tier due date system**: `dueTier()` returns `"overdue" | "due_today" | "due_tomorrow" | "due_soon" | null`. Badge variants map to: overdue→danger (red), due_today→orange, due_tomorrow→yellow, due_soon→green.

### Frequency / Repeat Picker
`src/components/ui/RepeatPicker.tsx` provides `RepeatPickerModal` for selecting task repeat frequency. Returns `{ frequencyType, frequencyDays, label }`. Frequency types are the DB enum: `daily | weekly | monthly | yearly | custom | no_repeat`. Sub-options include day-of-week multi-select, day-of-month (week + day), and custom (number + unit).

### Rich Text Notes
Activity (trip) notes support rich text via `react-native-pell-rich-editor`. Components:
- `RichTextEditor` — toolbar with Bold, Italic, Underline, Ordered List, Bullet List
- `RichTextViewer` — renders HTML (WebView on native, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on web)
- `plainTextToHtml()` / `htmlToPlainText()` — conversion utilities for migrating existing plain text notes
- Notes are stored as HTML in the `notes` column

### Home Page Data Aggregation
The Home screen (`app/(app)/(home)/index.tsx`) pulls data from multiple tabs:
- Recurring tasks and one-off tasks from the Tasks tab
- Projects with due dates from the Projects tab
- Project checklist items (via `useAllProjectTasks`) and trip checklist items (via `useAllTripTasks`)
- Service records with computed next-due dates
- Each item shows a source type label (Task, Project, Activity) and a Done button for inline completion

### Auto-Save Pattern
Task edit modals (low-lift, standalone, project-adjacent) in the Tasks tab use a 3-second debounced auto-save:
- `useRef` tracks the initial values when the modal opens (`llInitialRef`, `stInitialRef`, `paInitialRef`)
- A `useEffect` watches all editable fields, compares against initial values for dirty detection
- On dirty, sets a 3-second timeout to call the save function; clears previous timeout on each change
- "Done" button flushes any pending save immediately before closing
- After save, the initial ref is updated to the new values so the next dirty check works correctly

### Multi-Select Filter Pattern
Member filters across Home and Tasks tabs use `filterStore` (Zustand + AsyncStorage) for persistence. The store provides `memberFilter: string[]` (empty = All), `toggleMember(id)`, and `setMemberFilter(ids)`. Settings "Notify me about" has a "Select Multiples" checkbox that toggles between single-select (one at a time) and multi-select (combine "All" + individuals).

### Personal Task Privacy
`recurring_tasks` and `tasks` tables have an `is_personal` boolean column. When `is_personal` is true, the task is only visible to the assigned member. Filtering is done client-side via the `isVisible(assignedMemberId, isPersonal)` helper in Home and Tasks tabs. Edit modals expose a "Personal Task" Switch toggle.

### Realtime
`src/hooks/useRealtimeInvalidate.ts` subscribes to Supabase realtime channels and invalidates relevant query keys when rows change. `useHomeRealtime` is an alias for the global realtime hook.

### Path Alias
`@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js`). Use `@/lib/supabase`, `@/hooks/useHousehold`, etc.

### Type Files
- `src/types/database.types.ts` — Auto-generated Supabase types. Update manually when adding columns.
- `src/types/app.types.ts` — Composed/derived types used throughout the app (e.g. `ProjectWithOwners`, `TripWithTasks`).

### Key Data Model Notes
- `ideas` use `topic_id` as `household_id` (legacy column name — not a real topic foreign key)
- `household_invites` has `UNIQUE(household_id, email)` — delete the existing record before re-inviting the same email
- `household_members` has an `invite_token` column used for pending placeholder rows; filter with `.is("invite_token", null)` to get real members
- Service records have a `frequency` column (`monthly | quarterly | bi-annually | yearly`) used to compute next-due dates client-side on the Home dashboard
